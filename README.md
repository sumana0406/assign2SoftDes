->Although it works on other OSs too, we recommend WINDOWS.


-> To run the program, input the sequence of characters you want to type. 
The program then displays the number of Characters in total, followed by number of vowels in it and finally, 
it displays the number of digits present in the input. 



-> Please  note that this program excludes/ ignores " " spaces in the count.


-> Please note that this program considers a negative number or a decimal number / or
an input in general to be string. So If you want to calculate the significant figures etc, 
this program would not be able to output the appropriate output; As it is not meant for that purpose.

-> Although this program works with alphabets of different languages, it is intended to  be dealt with ENGLISH alphabets. 
There are few languages that use the combination of strokes; Therefore there'd be 2 characters in what appears to be a 
single character to us.
For example: తె(The/ sounds like て) is a 
Telugu character that is made up of two strokes త and e sound ె. 
Therefore, in the output, you might end up seeing a number higher than the value you might be expecting.
